Jittor is a high-performance deep learning framework based on JIT compiling and meta-operators. The whole framework and meta-operators are compiled just-in-time. A powerful op compiler and tuner are integrated into Jittor. It allowed us to generate high-performance code with specialized for your model. Jittor also contains a wealth of high-performance model libraries, including: image recognition, detection, segmentation, generation, differentiable rendering, geometric learning, reinforcement learning, etc. .


The front-end language is Python. Module Design and Dynamic Graph Execution is used in the front-end, which is the most popular design for deeplearning framework interface. The back-end is implemented by high performance language, such as CUDA,C++.

The following example shows how to model a two-layer neural network step by step and train from scratch In a few lines of Python code.


```python
import jittor as jt
from jittor import Module
from jittor import nn
import numpy as np

class Model(Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(1, 10)
        self.relu = nn.Relu() 
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def execute (self,x) :
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

def get_data(n): # generate random data for training test.
    for i in range(n):
        x = np.random.rand(batch_size, 1)
        y = x*x
        yield jt.float32(x), jt.float32(y)


learning_rate = 0.1
batch_size = 50
n = 1000

model = Model()
optim = nn.SGD(model.parameters(), learning_rate)

for i,(x,y) in enumerate(get_data(n)):
    pred_y = model(x)
    dy = pred_y - y
    loss = dy * dy
    loss_mean = loss.mean()
    optim.step(loss_mean)
    print(f"step {i}, loss = {loss_mean.data.sum()}")
```

Jittor offers three ways to install: pip, docker, or manual.


## Pip install


```bash
sudo apt install python3.7-dev libomp-dev
python3.7 -m pip install jittor
# or install from github(latest version)
# python3.7 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Jittor/jittor.git
python3.7 -m jittor.test.test_example
```



### macOS install


Please first install additional dependencies with [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install libomp
```


Then you can install jittor through pip and run the example.

```bash
python3.7 -m pip install jittor
python3.7 -m jittor.test.test_example
```


Currently jittor only supports CPU on macOS.


### Windows install



```bash
# check your python version(>=3.8)
python --version
python -m pip install jittor
# if conda is used
conda install pywin32
```


In Windows, jittor will automatically detect and install CUDA, please make sure your NVIDIA driver support CUDA 10.2  or above, or you can manually let jittor install CUDA for you:

```bash
python -m jittor_utils.install_cuda
```


## Docker Install



We provide a Docker installation method to save you from configuring the environment. The Docker installation method is as follows:

```
# CPU only(Linux)
docker run -it --network host jittor/jittor
# CPU and CUDA(Linux)
docker run -it --network host --gpus all jittor/jittor-cuda
# CPU only(Mac and Windows)
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 jittor/jittor
```


## manual install

We will show how to install Jittor in Ubuntu 16.04 step by step, Other Linux distributions may have similar commands.


### Step 1: Choose your back-end compiler


```bash
# g++
sudo apt install g++ build-essential libomp-dev

# OR clang++-8
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jittor/jittor/master/script/install_llvm.sh > /tmp/llvm.sh
bash /tmp/llvm.sh 8
```
### Step 2: Install Python and python-dev


Jittor need python version >= 3.7.


```bash
sudo apt install python3.7 python3.7-dev
```

### Step 3: Run Jittor


The whole framework is compiled Just-in-time. Let's install jittor via pip


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jittor/jittor.git
sudo pip3.7 install ./jittor
export cc_path="clang++-8"
# if other compiler is used, change cc_path
# export cc_path="g++"
# export cc_path="icc"

# run a simple test
python3.7 -m jittor.test.test_example
```
if the test is passed, your Jittor is ready.


### Optional Step 4: Enable CUDA


Using CUDA in Jittor is very simple, Just setup environment value `nvcc_path`


```bash
# replace this var with your nvcc location 
export nvcc_path="/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc" 
# run a simple cuda test
python3.7 -m jittor.test.test_cuda 
```
if the test is passed, your can use Jittor with CUDA by setting `use_cuda` flag.


```python
import jittor as jt
jt.flags.use_cuda = 1
```

### Optional Step 5: Test Resnet18 training


To check the integrity of Jittor, you can run Resnet18 training test. Note: 6G GPU RAM is requires in this test.


```bash
python3.7 -m jittor.test.test_resnet
```
if those tests are failed, please report bugs for us, and feel free to contribute ^_^


## Tutorial


In the tutorial section, we will briefly explain the basic concept of Jittor.


To train your model with Jittor, there are only three main concepts you need to know:


* Var: basic data type of jittor
* Operations: Jittor'op is simular with numpy

### Var


First, let's get started with Var. Var is the basic data type of jittor. Computation process in Jittor is asynchronous for optimization. If you want to access the data, `Var.data` can be used for synchronous data accessing.


```python
import jittor as jt
a = jt.float32([1,2,3])
print (a)
print (a.data)
# Output: float32[3,]
# Output: [ 1. 2. 3.]
```

And we can give the variable a name.


```python
a.name('a')
print(a.name())
# Output: a
```

### Operations


Jittor'op is simular with numpy. Let's try some operations. We create Var `a` and `b` via operation `jt.float32`, and add them. Printing those variables shows they have the same shape and dtype.


```python
import jittor as jt
a = jt.float32([1,2,3])
b = jt.float32([4,5,6])
c = a*b
print(a,b,c)
print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
# Output: float32[3,] float32[3,] float32[3,]
# Output: <class 'jittor_core.Var'> <class 'jittor_core.Var'> <class 'jittor_core.Var'>
```
Beside that, All the operators we used `jt.xxx(Var, ...)` have alias `Var.xxx(...)`. For example:


```python
c.max() # alias of jt.max(c)
c.add(a) # alias of jt.add(c, a)
c.min(keepdims=True) # alias of jt.min(c, keepdims=True)
```

if you want to know all the operation which Jittor supports. try `help(jt.ops)`. All the operation you found in `jt.ops.xxx`, can be used via alias `jt.xxx`.


```python
help(jt.ops)
# Output:
#   abs(x: core.Var) -> core.Var
#   add(x: core.Var, y: core.Var) -> core.Var
#   array(data: array) -> core.Var
#   binary(x: core.Var, y: core.Var, op: str) -> core.Var
#   ......
```
